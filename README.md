# Vortexa AI

### This GitHub repository contains all the Vortexa AI models. All these models are open-sourced and can be used by anyone. 

Vortexa AI is an AI model developed by me. Vortexa AI uses the Mistral 7B Instruct model as it's backend. But the main reason that Vortexa AI is different, is due to it's RAG. It uses state of the art RAG and is good in it's tasks. The entire Vortexa AI is coded in Python. The model contains 7 Billion parameters.

I would recommend to run this model on a machine that has a powerful a GPU. The response time of the model will vary based on your task and your GPU. 

These are all the mmodels ranked on overall intelligence:
1. Vortexa AI-- V2 PRO --4092 Tokens RAG
2. Vortexa AI-- V4 Reinforced --Bandit RAG
3. Vortexa AI-- V4 Advanced PRO --Mythomax RAG
4. Vortexa AI-- V4 Advanced --Mathematical Reasoning
5. Vortexa AI-- V2 Advanced PRO --4092 Tokens
6. Vortexa AI-- V1 --2048 Tokens RAG

Vortexa AI excels in the flied of Technology. The model "Vortexa AI-- V4 Advanced --Mathemtical Reasoning" excels in Maths. 

You would need to still install the backend to Vortexa AI. This is the hugging face link: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
Also install all the libraries required.
